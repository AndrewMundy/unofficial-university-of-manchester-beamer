Unofficial University of Manchester Beamer Theme
================================================
The distribution mechanism for the Unofficial University of Manchester Beamer
Theme is changing.
Alongside releases made via [GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewMundy/unofficial-university-of-manchester-beamer/releases/) we will be providing packages (or
the ability to build packages) for a variety of Linux distributions
(specifically Arch Linux, and Fedora and its many, many derivatives).
_As a result, cloning the repository, or downloading the repository is no
longer the recommended way to get the Beamer theme._ Furthermore,
documentation for the theme is provided at the point of installation, and The
University of Manchester Files have been removed from the package -- you must
source them yourself.

Getting and Installing the Beamer Theme

_Coming soon._
